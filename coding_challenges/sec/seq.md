Given two non-empty arrays of integers,writeafunction that determines whether the second
array isasubsequence of the first one.
Asubsequence of an array isaset of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but
that are in the same order as they appear in the array.For instance,the numbers[1,3,4]
formasubsequence of the array[1,2,3,4],and so do the numbers[2,4].Note thata
single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.
